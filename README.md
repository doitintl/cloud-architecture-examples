# cloud-architecture-examples

Ideal implementation examples for cloud architecture scenarios are showcased here, as designed by senior architects and engineers at DoiT International.

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a different design scenario. Within each folder, architectures are typically broken down further by cloud.

For example: An architecture showcasing ideal data warehousing solutions on each cloud might have a structure like this:

> `data_warehousing/[aws|gcp]/...`

Designs presented in this monorepo will convey cloud architecture scenarios through:

* A README detailing the overall scenario and the ideal solution state
* Diagrams
* Terraform enabling fully reproducible infrastructure
* Proof-of-concept sample code base
